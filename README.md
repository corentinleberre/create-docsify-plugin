# create-docsify-plugin

This repository contains a template for creating your own [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/) plugin from scratch. 
Using this template can help you get started quickly and ensure that your plugin follows best practices.

## Installation

Requirements : Node 16

To use this template you can clone this repository and use it as a starting point for your own plugin.

```bash
$: npx degit corentinleberre/create-docsify-plugin my-plugin
$: cd my-plugin
```

## Usage

Here is the structure of a project generated with this template. The code is stored in the **src** folder. By default Vitest is provided, so you can write your tests in the matching folder.

```
ğŸ“¦create-docsify-plugin
â”£ ğŸ“‚src
â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“‚plugin
â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“œmain.js
â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“œmy-plugin.js
â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“‚test
â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“œmy-plugin.spec.js
â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“œREADME.md
â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“œindex.html
â”£ ğŸ“œpackage.json
â”£ ğŸ“œREADME.md
â”— ğŸ“œvite-config.js
```

We use [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) as a dev server. This allows you to take advantage of hot reloading in development and easily build and minify code.

ğŸ‘‰ Run the dev server

```bash
$: npm run dev
```

ğŸ‘‰ Run the tests

```bash
$: npm run test
```

ğŸ‘‰ Build the plugin

```bash
$: npm run build
```

Two artifacts are generated. You have the choice to deliver it as a CommonJS module ou as an ESModule.

```
ğŸ“¦dist
 â”£ ğŸ“œmy-plugin.cjs
 â”— ğŸ“œmy-plugin.js
```

If you choose ESM, be aware that you will have to specify **type="module"** in your html import ğŸ‘‡

```html
<script type="module" src="dist/my-plugin.js"></script>
```
