# create-docsify-plugin

This repository contains a template for creating your own [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/) plugin from scratch. 
Using this template can help you get started quickly and ensure that your plugin follows best practices.

## Installation

Requirements : Node 16

To use this template you can clone this repository and use it as a starting point for your own plugin.

```bash
$: npx degit corentinleberre/create-docsify-plugin my-plugin
$: cd my-plugin
```

## Usage

Here is the structure of a project generated with this template. The code is stored in the **src** folder. By default Vitest is provided, so you can write your tests in the matching folder.

```text
ðŸ“¦create-docsify-plugin
â”£ ðŸ“‚src
â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚plugin
â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œmain.js
â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œmy-plugin.js
â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚test
â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œmy-plugin.spec.js
â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œREADME.md
â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œindex.html
â”£ ðŸ“œpackage.json
â”£ ðŸ“œREADME.md
â”— ðŸ“œvite-config.js
```

We use [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) as a dev server. This allows you to take advantage of hot reloading in development and easily build and minify code.

ðŸ‘‰ Run the dev server

```bash
$: npm run dev
```

ðŸ‘‰ Run the tests

```bash
$: npm run test
```

ðŸ‘‰ Build the plugin

```bash
$: npm run build
```

Two artifacts are generated. You have the choice to deliver it as a CommonJS module ou as an ESModule.

```text
ðŸ“¦dist
 â”£ ðŸ“œmy-plugin.cjs
 â”— ðŸ“œmy-plugin.js
```

If you choose ESM, be aware that you will have to specify **type="module"** in your html import ðŸ‘‡

```html
<script type="module" src="dist/my-plugin.js"></script>
```

## Examples

### Pass props to your plugin

You can define props that you can pass to your component this way ðŸ‘‡

```html
// src/index.html

<script>
    window.$docsify = {
        name: "My plugin documentation",

        myPlugin: {
            hello: "world",
        },
    };
</script>
```

They will be accessible trough the docsify global object in your plugin ðŸ‘‡

```javascript
// src/plugin/main.js

const props = docsify.myPlugin || {};
```

### Interact with Docsify lifecycle

>Docsify lifecycle hooks are provided via the **hook argument** passed to the plugin function.

You can attach your function to **6 differents lifecycle hooks** allowing your to modify the state of the app.

Below is the example included in the template for this project. This is a function that will be called once when the Docsify script is **initialized** on the first load of the application. This function will simply display the parameter you provide in the browser console.

```javascript
const myPlugin = (props = {hello: ""}) => (hook) => hook.init(() => {
    console.log(`hello ${props.hello}`);
});
```

To have more detail about lifecycle hooks check out the [official doc](https://docsify.js.org/#/write-a-plugin?id=lifecycle-hooks)

Here are detailed examples of plugins made using this template ðŸ‘‡

* [docsify-mermaid-zoom](https://github.com/corentinleberre/docsify-mermaid-zoom)
* [docsify-replace-pattern](https://github.com/corentinleberre/docsify-replace-pattern)

### Test your plugin

You can test your plugin using Vitest. We provide a simple test file that test the boilerplate function in **src/my-plugin.spec.js**.
