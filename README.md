# create-docsify-plugin

> Docsify is a popular and lightweight documentation generator that allows you to **easily create beautiful, intuitive documentation sites** based on your markdown documentations. It includes features like a search function, a table of contents, and the ability to customize the look and feel of the site using templates and custom CSS. Thanks to that it's a popular choice for open-source documentation sites and other purposes.
> If you want to extend Docsify's features, you can use [community plugins](https://github.com/docsifyjs/awesome-docsify#plugins) or **create your own Docsify plugin**.

This repository contains a template for creating your own [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/) plugin from scratch with Vite. Using this template will help you get to started quickly and ensure that your plugin follows best practices.

## Installation

> Requirements : Node 16

To use this template you can clone this repository and use it as a starting point for your own plugin ðŸ‘‡

```bash
$: npx degit corentinleberre/create-docsify-plugin my-plugin
$: cd my-plugin
```

## Usage

Here is the structure of a project generated with this template. The code is stored in the **src** folder. Vitest is provided, so you can write your tests in the matching folder.

```text
ðŸ“¦create-docsify-plugin
â”£ ðŸ“‚src
â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚plugin
â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œmain.js
â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œmy-plugin.js
â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚test
â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œmy-plugin.spec.js
â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œREADME.md
â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œindex.html
â”£ ðŸ“œpackage.json
â”£ ðŸ“œREADME.md
â”— ðŸ“œvite-config.js
```

We use [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) as a dev server. This allows you to take advantage of hot reloading in development and easily build and minify code with [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) integration.

ðŸ‘‰ Run the dev server

```bash
$: npm run dev
```

ðŸ‘‰ Run the tests

```bash
$: npm run test
```

ðŸ‘‰ Build the plugin

```bash
$: npm run build
```

You have the choice to deliver it as a CommonJS, ESModule, IIFE or UMD. By default, two artifacts CJS and ESM are generated. You can modify that in **vite-config.js**.

```text
ðŸ“¦dist
 â”£ ðŸ“œmy-plugin.cjs
 â”— ðŸ“œmy-plugin.js
```

After the build you can import the plugin in Docsify html ðŸ‘‡

```html
<script src="dist/my-plugin.js"></script>
```

## Examples

### Pass props to your plugin

You can define props that you can pass to your component this way ðŸ‘‡

```html
// src/index.html

<script>
  ...
  window.$docsify = {
      name: "My plugin documentation website",

      // props
      myPlugin: {
          hello: "world",
      },
  };
  ...
</script>
```

They will be accessible through the docsify global object in your plugin ðŸ‘‡

```javascript
// src/plugin/main.js

const props = docsify.myPlugin || {};
```

### Interact with Docsify lifecycle hooks

> Docsify lifecycle hooks are provided via the **hook argument** passed to the plugin function.

You can attach your function to **6 differents lifecycle hooks** allowing your to modify the state of the app.

Below is the example included in the template for this project. This is a function that will be called once when the Docsify script is **initialized** on the first load of the application. This function will simply display the parameter provided in the browser console.

```javascript
const myPlugin =
  (props = { hello: "" }) =>
  (hook) =>
    hook.init(() => {
      console.log(`hello ${props.hello}`);
    });
```

To have more detail about lifecycle hooks check out the [official doc](https://docsify.js.org/#/write-a-plugin?id=lifecycle-hooks).

The example is deliberately **very simple** here, but it is possible to modify the rendering from Docsify, you can for example add a button to copy and paste the current paragraph when hovering the content or add a custom footer on each page.

Here are detailed examples of plugins made using this template ðŸ‘‡

- [docsify-replace-pattern](https://github.com/corentinleberre/docsify-replace-pattern)

### Test your plugin

You can test your plugin using Vitest. We provide a simple test file that test the plugin function in **src/my-plugin.spec.js**.

### Deploy your plugin

To deploy this package on npm, you will need to have an account on npmjs.com. Once you have an account, follow these steps:

- Build the project with **npm run build**
- Run **npm publish**

You can now access your package on npm with this url ðŸ‘‰ [https://www.npmjs.com/package/my-docsify-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/my-docsify-plugin).

To use this package on your website we will use Jsdelivr.com. It will act as [Content Delivery Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network) proxying your npm package enabling you to use this script directly in the browser.

You can get your plugin threw this url ðŸ‘‰ [https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/my-docsify-plugin@version/dist/my-plugin.js](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/my-docsify-plugin@version/dist/my-plugin.js)

Now your users just have to add this url directly in their Docsify **index.html** page to use your plugin ðŸ‘‡

```html
<script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/my-docsify-plugin@version/dist/my-plugin.js"></script>
```

If you specified **"main": "dist/my-plugin.js"** in package.json, you could also access it directly with this url ðŸ‘‰ [https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/my-docsify-plugin@1.0.0](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/my-docsify-plugin@version)
